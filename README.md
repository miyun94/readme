# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Description 
As a developer, it is important to have a solid readme file that overviews the project. It allows the users to see what the application is used for, how to use it, and the other finer details such as the contributors and those to contact. This readme generator allows the user to easily generate a quality readme just by going through and answering each prompt. It skips the hassle of setting up each individual readme over and over again. 

## Installation 
To use this project clone the repo and make sure you have the inquirer npm installed as well.

## Usage 
Once you have everything installed, in your terminal, make sure you are in the correct folder and type in ‘index.js’ to begin and start filling out all the prompts given. After all the questions are answered, it will generate a readme.md file with the user’s inputs.
